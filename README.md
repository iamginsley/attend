# Attend

The project is a sophisticated digital attendance management system designed for modern educational institutions. It aims to replace manual attendance tracking with a reliable, traceable, and secure digital solution, seamlessly integrating into existing IT infrastructures. The system enables teachers to generate unique attendance codes at the start of each class, which students can enter within a specified timeframe to register their presence. The system checks the authenticity of locations using network and GPS data to ensure presence within the classroom. Additionally, the system provides real-time attendance monitoring and detailed participation reports through an intuitive user interface accessible via mobile and desktop devices. This system not only reduces administrative burdens but also enhances students' responsibility in managing their course engagements.
